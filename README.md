# M1-Volatlity2
Install all the required depencies needed for Volatlity 2.
## Problem
Currently on a M1 Mac, had a few issues installing Volatlity 2 on a fresh VM via Parallels/VMFusion. I had to look for workarounds before finally getting it to work. 
## Solution
Created a script that installs all the required dependencies needed for Volatlity 2 to run on my M1 Mac.
