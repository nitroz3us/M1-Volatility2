# M1-Volatility2
## Problem
Currently on a M1 Mac, had a few issues installing Volatility 2 on a fresh VM via Parallels/VMFusion. I had to look for workarounds before finally getting it to work. 
## Solution
Created a script that installs all the required dependencies needed for Volatility 2 to run on my M1 Mac.

## Note
Remember to give executable rights on the script!

```shell
chmod +x vol2install.sh
```
